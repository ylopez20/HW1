Test Cases
Problem 1: Select the number of inputs. I want to make sure 5 lines work.
I input BunRun, Mud1234, zombee, murk, and 2019Spartan. 


Problem 2: I made a list of integers 1 2 3 3 2 1 1 0. I also made the same sequence vertically.  I repeated this step for the sequences 1 1 0, 1 1 0, 3 3 3 3 0, and 3 3 3 0. 

Problem 3: I decided to select 5 usernames. I used Jared Pohlmann, Ashton Oak, aaa bbb, tttt jjjj, and Jeff Ifland.
